# Welcome to The Blog of Food!
Welcome to my blog! Here you will find amazing pictures of food. Each week, I will pick a few pictures of food emailed to me to post on the blog, as well as posting my own. If you have pictures you would like to share, email them(with a caption!) to foodpixman@outlook.com. Who knowsâ€”you might be featured on the blog!


### Here is a picture of some food art that I made out of some cucumbers and carrots!
"A rocket made out of a carrot and a compass made out of a cucumber."
